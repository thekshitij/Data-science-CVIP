Create a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features using the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training regression models to predict prices accurately. The model will be evaluated for its predictive accuracy, offering a valuable tool for real estate professionals and potential buyers to understand housing market trends and make informed decisions.
